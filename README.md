# Student Sleep vs Stress Analysis

This project demonstrates a data preprocessing workflow and analysis using Python (pandas).

### Steps:
1. Loaded the dataset and inspected missing values / duplicates.
2. Cleaned text columns by removing special characters.
3. Calculated the overall average sleep hours.
4. Identified students who sleep more than average but still report high stress.

### Key Insight:
- Students with IDs **104 (Meena)** and **106 (Latha)** sleep above average but report **High stress**.
